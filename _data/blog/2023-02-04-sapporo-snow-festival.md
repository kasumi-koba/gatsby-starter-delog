I went to Sapporo Snow Festival in Odori Park.\
This Festival is a traditional event in Sapporo City.

All photographs by the author.  

# H﻿uge Snow Statues

there are five huge snow statues at the festival.\
We can watch lit-up show statues from 5. p.m to 10. p.m during the festival.

# citizen’s snow statue

These photographs show citizen’s snow statues.

Many people - businesspersons, university students, and high school students made their original snow statues.

We can watch a lot of animated characters, like Anya(SPIxFAMILY).

# shops

there are some souvenir shops and food shops.

\
I was surprised that I saw matryoshka again because we can see it in Sapporo white illumination.

this year, food shop is fewer than before covid plandemic.

but a big crowd was near the food shop, it’s under the Sapporo television tower.
