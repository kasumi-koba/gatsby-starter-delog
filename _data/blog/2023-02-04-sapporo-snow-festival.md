I went to Sapporo Snow Festival in Odori Park.\
This Festival is a traditional event in Sapporo City.

# H﻿uge Snow Statues

there are five huge snow statues at the festival.\
We can see lit-up show statues from 5. p.m to 10. p.m during the festival.

# citizen’s snow statue

These photographs show citizen’s snow statues.

Many people - businesspersons, university students, and high school students made their original snow statues.

We can watch a lot of animated characters, like Anya(SPIxFAMILY).
